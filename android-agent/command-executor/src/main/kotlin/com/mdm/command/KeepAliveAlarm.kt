/**
 * AlarmManager-based service-respawn loop. Why it exists alongside
 * [KeepAliveWorker]:
 *
 *   - WorkManager's PeriodicWorkRequest has a 15-minute OS-enforced floor and
 *     is subject to App Standby + Doze deferrals. On aggressively-managed
 *     devices (OEMs like Xiaomi, Huawei; even stock Pixel 12+ at low battery)
 *     the actual cadence stretches to 30-60 minutes between firings.
 *   - With our 150-second "online" window in the admin UI, that gap shows as
 *     `disconnected` for tens of minutes after the FG service is killed.
 *
 * `setAndAllowWhileIdle` ticks roughly every [INTERVAL_MS] (3 minutes) even
 * during Doze maintenance windows. Each tick fires our [Receiver] which
 * idempotently re-starts [CommandService]. The alarm is self-rescheduling so
 * a single OS-tick keeps the chain running forever.
 *
 * Drains battery slightly more than WorkManager would; on a Device-Owner-
 * managed phone that's the correct tradeoff.
